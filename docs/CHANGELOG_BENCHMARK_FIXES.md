# Benchmark System Fixes - October 20, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ Model Name Not in Benchmark Filename
**Problem**: Benchmark files were named `benchmark_20251020_nonce.md` without model identification

**Solution**: Updated filename format to include model name
- **New format**: `benchmark_{model_name}_{YYYYMMDD}_{nonce}.md`
- **Example**: `benchmark_Qwen_Qwen3_0_6B_w8a8_opt0_hybr_20251020_51cecj.md`

**Changed Files**:
- `scripts/benchmark_full.py` - Updated `generate_filename()` method

### 2. ❌ Prompts Not Saved in Reports
**Problem**: Markdown reports showed empty prompts because `prompt_text` field didn't exist

**Solution**: Added `prompt_text` field to `PerformanceMetrics` dataclass
- Stores actual prompt text separately from response
- Updated markdown generation to use correct fields

**Changed Files**:
- `scripts/benchmark.py`:
  - Added `prompt_text: str = ""` to `PerformanceMetrics`
  - Updated `run_single_inference()` to store prompt
- `scripts/benchmark_full.py`:
  - Fixed `add_test_result()` to use `metrics.prompt_text` for prompts
  - Fixed `add_test_result()` to use `metrics.response_text` for responses

### 3. ❌ No Auto-Loading of Models
**Problem**: Benchmark failed if no model was already loaded

**Solution**: Implemented automatic model loading in API endpoints
- Added `ensure_model_loaded()` helper function
- Auto-loads first available model if none is loaded
- Only loads once - won't reload on every request

**Changed Files**:
- `src/api/openai_routes.py`:
  - Added `ensure_model_loaded()` function
  - Updated `create_chat_completion()` to auto-load
  - Updated `stream_chat_completion()` to auto-load

### 4. ❌ No Stabilization Time After Model Load
**Problem**: Benchmarks started immediately after loading, possibly before model was fully ready

**Solution**: Added 5-second wait after successful model load
- Ensures model is fully initialized
- Prevents artificially high TTFT on first request

**Changed Files**:
- `scripts/benchmark.py`:
  - Added `time.sleep(5)` after successful model load

## Before vs After

### Before
```bash
# Filename - no model identification
benchmark_20251020_abc123.md

# Empty prompts in markdown
### Prompt
```
```

# No model loaded - benchmark fails
❌ Failed to load model: No model loaded

# Immediate benchmark after load - possible timing issues
✅ Model loaded successfully!
[Starting benchmark immediately...]
```

### After
```bash
# Filename - includes model name
benchmark_Qwen_Qwen3_0_6B_w8a8_opt0_hybr_20251020_51cecj.md

# Actual prompts captured
### Prompt
```
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are revolutionizing...
```

# Auto-loading works
✅ Model loaded successfully!
⏳ Waiting 5 seconds for model to stabilize...

# Proper initialization time
[5 second wait]
[Starting benchmark...]
```

## Testing Results

Tested with Qwen 0.6B model:
- ✅ Auto-loading successful
- ✅ 5-second stabilization wait added
- ✅ Prompts captured correctly in markdown
- ✅ Model name in filename
- ✅ 10/10 tests successful
- ✅ All metrics collected

## API Improvements

### New Auto-Loading Behavior

```python
# Before - manual load required
POST /v1/models/load {"model": "...", ...}
# Then use API

# After - auto-loads on first request
POST /v1/chat/completions {"messages": [...]}
# Auto-loads first available model if needed
```

### Auto-Load Logic
1. Check if model already loaded → use it
2. If not loaded → get available models
3. If preferred model specified → try to load it
4. Otherwise → load first available model
5. If load fails → return HTTP 500 error

### Benefits
- ✅ Simpler benchmarking workflow
- ✅ No manual model management needed
- ✅ Smart: Only loads once, reuses existing model
- ✅ Prevents unnecessary reloads (important for TTFT!)

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
1. `src/api/openai_routes.py` - Auto-loading logic
2. `scripts/benchmark.py` - Prompt capture + stabilization wait
3. `scripts/benchmark_full.py` - Filename generation + prompt display

### Documentation
4. `docs/CHANGELOG_BENCHMARK_FIXES.md` - This file

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Benchmarks

Old benchmark files are still valid but use old naming:
```
benchmarks/benchmark_20251020_w7wxn9.md  # Old format (no model name)
```

New benchmarks will use improved naming:
```
benchmarks/benchmark_Qwen_Qwen3_0_6B_w8a8_opt0_hybr_20251020_51cecj.md  # New format
```

### For API Users

No breaking changes! The API is backward compatible:
- Manual model loading still works: `POST /v1/models/load`
- Auto-loading only activates if no model is loaded
- Existing code continues to work unchanged

## Performance Impact

### Positive
- ✅ 5-second wait ensures stable measurements
- ✅ Auto-loading eliminates setup errors
- ✅ Prevents accidental model reloads

### Neutral
- First request may trigger model load (one-time ~5s overhead)
- Subsequent requests use loaded model (no overhead)
- Manual pre-loading still recommended for production

## Next Steps

Once Phase 3 (RKLLM integration) is complete:
1. Responses will be populated (currently empty)
2. Quality comparison will be meaningful
3. Token generation speeds will be real
4. Auto-loading will demonstrate actual model differences

## Known Limitations

### Current (Phase 2)
- Responses are still empty (placeholder implementation)
- Tokens/sec shows 0.00 (no real generation)
- TTFT measures API latency only (not NPU inference)

### Will Fix in Phase 3
- Real text generation from RKLLM
- Actual token streaming
- True NPU performance metrics
- Meaningful quality comparison
