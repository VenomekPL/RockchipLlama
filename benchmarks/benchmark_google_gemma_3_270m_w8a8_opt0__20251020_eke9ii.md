The effects of climate change on the ocean have long been a topic of research. Scientists study different aspectses oceans to see if their effects are greater than expected and how much affect them, from changing species habitats, temperature extremes, or increasing sea levels. But what about the ocean? The water around us is just as we know it today. Ocean currents move across our planet, carrying away nutrients like oxygen, plankts like phytoplankton, and rocks like coral reefs, which make up the majority of all marine life on earth. They also help regulate climate by keeping warm in summer, cooling during winter, and protecting from storms by wayward waves in the ocean that can create trouble if they reach our shores.

```

### Response

```
 The fall of the Roman empire was caused by the combination of several factors. One factor that contributed to its downfall was the rise of the Greek army in Asia Minor which resulted in an increased reliance on Greece's economy for defense against the invasion of Rome led to a decline in the population of Greece and the expansion of Greek influence. The other factor contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire was the weakening of the Roman navy, as well as the emergence of Byzantine military forces in Asia Minor.
