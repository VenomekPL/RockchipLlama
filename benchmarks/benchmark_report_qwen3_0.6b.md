```

**Response:**
```
**Title: The Cat of the Lost Dragon**

In the quiet village of Eldermere, young apprentice mage Elira had always been a curious and restless soul. She loved the world beyond the village gates, where magic shimmered and dreams danced. But one day, she stumbled upon a peculiar house cat named Mira, who looked more like a dragon than a cat. Mira had a tail as long as a dragon‚Äôs and her eyes were like molten gold. Elira was mesmerized, but she was not yet ready to believe she was the first to find her.

One evening, as Elira studied the cat, she noticed something unusual. Mira had a habit of curling up and hiding in the shadows, but that night, she curled up in a way that made her look like a dragon. Elira felt a strange connection to Mira and decided to take her to the village hall. There, she found Mira in her usual cozy home, but now she was wrapped in a dragon‚Äôs wings and her fur was a mix of gold and black. Elira was confused, but she felt something deeper‚Äîsomething that made her want to understand more.

As Elira spent more time with Mira, she began to notice that Mira‚Äôs movements were more fluid, her eyes more intense. She could sense something ancient and ancient magic was inside her. Elira started to notice that Mira was not just a cat anymore‚Äîshe was a living piece of history, a dragon who had been hidden for ages and had been waiting for a person to find her. Elira felt a sense of wonder and purpose, and she felt she had found her own role in the world.

One day, Mira appeared in the village square, her wings still glowing. Elira was hesitant to approach, but when she did, she found Mira standing in the middle of the square, her wings unfurled. She had a heart of gold and a heart of mystery. Elira realized that Mira was not just a cat; she was a living legend, and she had been waiting for her to find her.

In the end, Elira and Mira became close, and they became friends. Mira showed her the magic that was hidden within her, and Elira learned that magic was not just for the powerful, but for the ones who had a connection to the past. Together, they became a pair of friends who had found their true selves.

- `top_k` from 20 to 1 (greedy decoding)
- `temperature` from 0.6 to 0.8 (standard setting)
